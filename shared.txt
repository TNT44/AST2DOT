Description:
Convert graphviz AST to DOT.

When you use Graphviz you create a .dot file or a .gz file.
You can parse a .dot file, a .gz file to an AST tree with 
[avanka dotparser](https://github.com/anvaka/dotparser).

The AST tree can be modified with javascript's function, like add a node.

I build a program to revert the process.
I create a new .dot file from an AST tree.
